# ZSH

My config needs :
- oh-my-zsh .
- oh-my-zsh plugins : zsh-autosuggestions .
- oh-my-zsh plugin : zsh-syntax-highlighting .
- oh-my-zsh theme : Spaceship Prompt Theme .
- colorscripts : From Distrotube .

Keep in note that my custom command called "about" needs
an executable script file called about_zsh.sh .

You have to change the path of the file first.
And then, copy the content of the about_zsh.sh ( On my Github repo ) 
into about_zsh.sh in your computer.
