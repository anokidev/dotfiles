# ZSH

My config needs powerlevel10k, NeoVim, MesloLGS NF fonts for powerlevel10k, and oh-my-zsh.

Keep in note that my custom command called "about" needs
an executable script file called about_zsh.sh .

You have to change the path of the file first.
And then, copy the content of the about_zsh.sh ( On my Github repo ) 
into about_zsh.sh in your computer. 

Powerlevel10k let's go !
