# i3-gaps

For those of you who don't know, i3 is a X11 tiled window manager for *NIX OS.
i3-gaps is a fork of i3 that adds gaps. I use i3 and I gain a production boost.

Keep in mind that my i3-gaps config needs :

- Bumblebee Status for i3 status bar.
- Alacritty for terminal emulator.
- Google Chrome Stable for web browser.
- Thunar for file manager.
- XFCE4 App Finder for program finder.
- Flameshot for screenshoot tool.
- XFCE4 Settings Manager and LXAppearance for settings app.
- feh for wallpaper applier.

Download the file named config, and then put in inside ~/.config/i3 . Not ~/.config/i3-gaps .
