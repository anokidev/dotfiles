# Bash.

Mostly default. Manjaro default.
Put the content of the .bashrc inside ~/.bashrc.
Same with the .bash_profile.

Keep in note that my custom command called "about" needs
an executable script file called about_bash.sh .

You have to change the path of the file first.
And then, copy the content of the about_bash.sh ( On my Github repo ) 
into about_bash.sh in your computer.
