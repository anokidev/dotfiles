# i3

For those of you who don't know, i3 is a X11 tiled window manager for *NIX OS.
I use i3 and I gain a production boost.

Keep in mind that my i3 config needs :

- Polybar for i3 status bar.
- Alacritty for terminal emulator.
- Google Chrome for web browser.
- Thunar for file manager.
- XFCE4 App Finder for program finder.
- XFCE4 Screenshooter for screenshoot tool.

Download the file named config, and then put in inside ~/.config/i3 .
